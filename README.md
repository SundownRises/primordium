# 🌌 Primordium

Welcome to **Primordium**.

---

Long gone are the days when individuals had to lose all their data to private companies, sacrificing autonomy and risking privacy.

With **Primordium**, **you** decide when and where your data gets used — and get paid for it.

---

## 🚀 Our Vision
Using our tech stack powered by **0g-storage** and **0g-AI**, we make **you the owner of your data**.  
We refine it for industrial use and reward you with an **iNFT** to mark your ownership over that data.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Upload Your Data**  
   Connect your wallet to upload your data.  
   *No funds are required — our backend covers the fees.*

2. **Data Processing**  
   Your data is cleaned, processed, anonymized, and uploaded on **0g-storage servers**, then pinned for persistence.

3. **AI Training**  
   Categorized data is used to train specialized AIs that solve real-world problems.

4. **Get Rewarded**  
   Each time your data is used (raw or via AI models), you get paid.  
   Rewards come in the form of **iNFTs**, acting as ownership markers for your contribution.
